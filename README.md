# Placesgram-webapp
Website application that involves using the MERN tech stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js)
The application currently is still being developed, and only the front end is set up. 
I will continue to work on the backend and the APIs
I will also connect the backend to the front end, and have the backend request data from the mongodb database.
